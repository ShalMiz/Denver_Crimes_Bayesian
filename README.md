# Bayesian Analysis of Crime Rate in Denver, Colorado

A neighbourhood with a lower crime rate to live is a major factor considered in the property investment decision. Identifying high crime neighbourhoods is a useful factor for assigning police forces as well. In this project, we aim to categorize neighbours based on the crime rate as either a high crime rate or a lower crime
rate compared to the average monthly crime rate. We study the crime rates in neighbourhoods of the city and county of Denver, Colorado. The objective of this project is to model monthly crime rate category based on two different Bayesian models using Gibbs sampling.
